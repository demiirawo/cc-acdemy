# Security Audit Report - Care Cuddle Academy Knowledge Base

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security review was conducted on the Care Cuddle Academy Knowledge Base application. Critical vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed, including privilege escalation, XSS vulnerabilities, and database security issues.

## Critical Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Users could potentially change their own roles in the profiles table
**Impact**: Complete access control bypass
**Fix**: 
- Added server-side trigger to prevent non-admin role changes
- Separated profile updates from role management
- Only admins can now modify user roles

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Multiple components used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
**Impact**: Remote code execution, session hijacking, data theft
**Locations Fixed**:
- `src/components/EnhancedContentEditor.tsx`
- `src/components/KnowledgeBaseApp.tsx`
- `src/components/PublicPageView.tsx`
**Fix**: 
- Implemented DOMPurify-based HTML sanitization
- Created centralized security utility functions
- All user content now sanitized before rendering

### 3. Database Function Security Issues (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Functions using `SECURITY DEFINER` without proper search path isolation
**Impact**: Potential privilege escalation and SQL injection
**Fix**: 
- Updated all functions to use `SET search_path = ''`
- Secured function execution environment
- Added proper access controls

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed ✅

### 4. Email Domain Validation Bypass (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Client-side only email domain restriction could be bypassed
**Impact**: Unauthorized user registration
**Fix**: 
- Added server-side email domain validation trigger
- Maintains client-side validation for UX
- Domain restriction now enforced at database level

### 5. Input Validation Improvements (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Limited URL validation in content editor
**Impact**: Malicious links in content
**Fix**: 
- Added URL validation for links and images
- Restricted to safe protocols (http, https, mailto)
- User feedback for invalid URLs

## New Security Features ✅

### 1. Security Audit Logging
- Created `security_audit_log` table
- Function to log security events
- Admin-only access to audit logs
- Tracks role changes and security events

### 2. Centralized Security Library
- `src/lib/security.ts` - Core security functions
- HTML sanitization with DOMPurify
- URL validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting utilities
- Content Security Policy directives

### 3. Enhanced User Role Management
- `src/lib/userManagement.ts` - Secure role management
- Role caching with TTL
- Security event logging
- Admin permission validation

## Database Migrations Applied ✅

1. **Role Protection Trigger**: Prevents unauthorized role changes
2. **Email Domain Validation**: Server-side domain restriction
3. **Function Security**: Updated all functions with secure search paths
4. **Audit Logging**: Security event tracking system

## Security Headers & CSP (Ready for Implementation)

Content Security Policy directives defined in `src/lib/security.ts`:
- Restricted script sources
- Safe font and style sources
- Limited connection sources
- Frame protection
- Object restrictions

## Ongoing Security Recommendations

### 1. Authentication Hardening
- Consider implementing session timeout
- Add failed login attempt monitoring
- Enable two-factor authentication

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Implement API rate limiting
- Add CAPTCHA for repeated failed attempts
- Monitor for suspicious activity patterns

### 3. Regular Security Reviews
- Quarterly security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting
- Set up security event monitoring
- Alert on multiple failed logins
- Monitor privilege escalation attempts

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Test role change restrictions
2. ✅ Verify HTML content sanitization
3. ✅ Confirm email domain validation
4. ✅ Check database function security
5. ✅ Validate audit logging functionality

## Summary

All critical and medium-priority security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The application now includes:

- **Privilege escalation protection**
- **XSS prevention** through content sanitization
- **Database security** improvements
- **Server-side validation** enforcement
- **Security audit logging**
- **Enhanced input validation**

The security posture has been significantly improved, with proper defense-in-depth measures implemented across the application stack.
